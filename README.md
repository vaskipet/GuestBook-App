# GuestBook-App
PHP Course project
GUESTBOOK – The “Hello World” of CRUD Apps.

This simple guestbook application was created for PHP course in Laurea University of Applied Sciences.
The objective of the project was to create a simple guestbook feature that allows users to create accounts and allows them to send comments. Most of this was made using mmtuts.net -tutorials and class material. I have added some small feaures, responsiveness and added prepared statements and comments to the code. 

        •	Users are required to create an account on the website in order to:
          o	Comment
          o	Edit own comments (only the right user can edit his/her own comment)
          o	Delete own comments
        •	Passwords are encrypted.
        
How to Setup locally:

•	Download the .ZIP from this GitHub repository.

•	Save the folder under "C:\xampp\htdocs" directory and name it "guestbook".

•	Launch Apache and MySQL (with XAMPP for example).

•	Go to phpMyAdmin, create a database "pulina2" and import the .SQL script 

•	Open "http://localhost:8080/guestbook/index.php" in your web browser (assuming "8080" is your Apache port number, which is "80" by default).
